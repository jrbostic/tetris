tetris
======

This program was coauthored by the instructor Alan Fowler for the TCSS305 course at the University of Washington Tacoma.  Professor Fowler provided the model for the Tetris board (the dimensions and fundamental behavior of blocks).  I provided the GUI features, including custom sound, statistics displays, and a number of other optional features.
